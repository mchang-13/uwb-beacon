# Voltage Regulator

## Overview

This PCB design is for a voltage regulator that will supply an Intel Up Board Squared with 5 V and 3 A. The power supply is a LiPo drone battery. The measured nominal voltage of the battery is 15.5 V.

## Schematic

This is the simulation schematic I used to test the regulator. I validated the circuit by using the operating parameters of the battery and micro-controller we were using.
